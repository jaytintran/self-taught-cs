### What is Big O Notation?
`Wikipedia Version`
- It's a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

`Caveman Version`
- It's a term to describe the performance of an algorithm - a step by step instruction to accomplish something.

`IT Version`
- We use this term to measure the perfomance of an algorithms, and it helps us decide if this algorithm scales well or not with the larger the data set.

> **O(n)**

- Now this will have to do everything with Data Structures, certain operations can be more and less costly depending what data structures we use.
- For example accessing an **array** is super fast, it has a fix length, but it will get costly when our size of input grows.
- Then what we have to do is to use another data structure like **linked list** insted of array, this type of data structure can grows or shrinks very quickly.
- We have to learn about Big O Notation first before speaking about other data structures.
